Video 8 - Section Intro: Node.js Module System
------------------
Start the note taking app.
Features of node.

The node module system.
- allows us to load functionality into the app.
- connect to database
- setup web server

Types of modules:
- core Modules - Included with node install.
- third party modules
- load in modules you have created.


Video 9 - Importing Node.js Core Modules
--------------------
Some modules require being loaded in before using them.
Some modules are global variables.
File System module.
Read, write, check if directory exists.

fs.writeFileSync(file, data)
fs.writeFile(file, data, callback)

Allows us to write data to a file on our file system

require is how we load modules in node.js
modules return a variable.

const fs = require('fs')

There is a common module variable name people use for each
required module. You can check that information in the docs.

Video 10 - Importing your own files
-------------------------

add a utils.js

console.log the file name in utils.js

require('./utils.js')

You will notice it logs once you require.

create a name variable in utils

all of your files have their own scope.

app cannot access utils even though it was required.

module.exports = name

defines all of the things we share with other files.

whatever we define to module.exports will be shared with other files that require.

create add function

export the add function

challenge define and use a function in a new file.
create a getNote function return 'Your notes..
export new function from the new file.
file should be notes.js
